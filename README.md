# Hello-World
This is the repository that GitHub told me to make so that I would know how to make repositories.

I work in digital marketing and have some experience with coding, but not really enough to say that I'm a coder. I'm taking a Front-End Web Development course with General Assembly so that I can learn more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm hoping to be able to use this newfound knowledge to advance my career and possibly change jobs.
